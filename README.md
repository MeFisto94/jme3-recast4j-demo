# jme3-recast4j-demo
This is a demonstrational Application to show how the abstractionalbBindings to use recast4j (a java only port of recast+detour) in jMonkeyEngine 3 can be used
Later this demo will use maven/jCenter to get the latest version of jme3-recast4j, currently you have to build it your own and place it into this directory as jme3-recast4j.jar.
The Repo will come with it pre-packaged but that might be outdated and removed in the future
